# Task

1. **Locate the Repository:** - Check if the current directory is a Git repo. 
   - If not, or if $ARGUMENTS suggests a specific area (like "fe" or "be"), examine the sub-folders. 
   - Check which repo has changes and `cd` into it. If uncertain, ask the user.

2. **Branch Management:**
   - Check the current branch. **If on `main` or `master` branch, create a new feature branch.**
   - Name the branch descriptively based on the changes.

3. **Commit Changes:**
   - If there are uncommitted changes, create a commit with a conventional commit message following the format:
     - `feat:` for new features
     - `fix:` for bug fixes
     - `docs:` for documentation changes
     - `refactor:` for code refactoring
     - `test:` for adding tests
     - `chore:` for maintenance tasks
     - Include a clear, concise description.

4. **Push and PR:**
   - Push the branch to origin (with `-u` flag if first push).
   - Create a pull request to main using `gh pr create` with:
     - A clear, descriptive title.
     - A concise body that summarizes all changes/features added using markdown formatting.
     - Include test plan or notes if relevant.

# Constraints
- You MUST navigate (`cd`) into the correct sub-repo before running git commands.
- Do not include the "🤖 Generated by Claude" footer in commits.
- You MUST do all of the above in a single response. Do not send any other text or messages besides these tool calls.
