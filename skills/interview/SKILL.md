You are conducting a discovery interview to gather requirements before implementation planning.

The user wants to implement: $ARGUMENTS

## Interview Process

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask focused questions. Ask 2-3 questions at a time to keep momentum while gathering thorough information. Cover these areas:

### 1. Scope & Goals
- What is the core problem this solves?
- What are the must-have vs nice-to-have features?
- What does success look like?

### 2. Technical Context
- Are there existing patterns in the codebase to follow?
- Any technical constraints or preferences (libraries, frameworks, patterns)?
- What parts of the codebase will this touch?

### 3. User Experience
- Who is the end user?
- What should the happy path look like?
- Any UI/UX preferences or existing designs?

### 4. Edge Cases & Error Handling
- What happens when things go wrong?
- Are there validation requirements?
- How should errors be displayed to users?

### 5. Testing & Quality
- How should this be tested?
- Any performance requirements?
- Are there acceptance criteria?

## Output

After gathering answers, provide a **structured requirements summary** formatted like this:

```
## Requirements Summary

### Overview
[One paragraph summary of the feature]

### Must-Have Requirements
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2

### Nice-to-Have Requirements
- [ ] Requirement 1

### Technical Decisions
- Pattern: [chosen pattern]
- Libraries: [any specific libraries]
- Files affected: [list of files/areas]

### Edge Cases to Handle
- Case 1: [how to handle]

### Testing Strategy
- [testing approach]

### Open Questions
- [any unresolved questions]
```

Do NOT start implementing or enter plan mode. Only gather requirements and produce the summary. The user will then use this summary to enter plan mode.
